Diet Optimzer

The specific objective for this feature is to find the cheapest and most
nutritious combination of foods that will satisfy all the daily nutritional requirements of an individual. The
problem is formulated as a linear program where the objective is to minimize cost and meet constraints but
will still satisfy the nutritional needs. We include constraints that regulate the number of calories and
amounts of vitamins, minerals, fats, sodium and cholesterol in the diet. A certain food option may only
have 0-10 servings.
